Phase 1: Data Exploration & Preparation  
1. Read the FIT file: We’ll extract heart rate, cadence, stride length, power, speed, and timestamps.  
2. Resample to 1-minute intervals: Calculate the moving average to smooth out the data.  
3. Visualize the data: Let’s understand how these features behave — time series plots and correlation heatmaps will help here.  

Phase 2: Build a Baseline Model  
4. Choose a target metric: For efficiency, let’s start by predicting pace (min/km) or running power.  
5. Feature selection: Heart rate, cadence, stride length, power, and speed — maybe derived metrics like power-to-speed ratio.  
6. Train a simple model: Start with a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting model — they’re good at showing feature importance.  

Phase 3: Interpret Results  
7. Feature importance: Identify which features most influence efficiency.  
8. Check interactions: See if a combination of cadence + power, or heart rate + speed, stands out.  
9. Make it repeatable: Once we have this, we’ll set up the workflow so you can upload a new FIT file and get a report on the most efficient metrics.
