# Power-to-Weight Ratio Calculation

## What is Power-to-Weight Ratio?

The **Power-to-Weight Ratio (PWR)** is a measure of how much power you can generate relative to your body weight. Itâ€™s widely used in endurance sports like running and cycling to assess efficiency and performance.

## Formula

The formula to calculate PWR is:

\[
\text{PWR} = \frac{\text{Average Power (in watts)}}{\text{Body Weight (in kg)}}
\]

### Example:
If your average power is **300 watts** and your body weight is **70 kg**, the calculation would be:

\[
\text{PWR} = \frac{300}{70} = 4.29 \, \text{watts per kilogram (W/kg)}
\]

## Why is PWR Important?

A higher Power-to-Weight Ratio means you are more efficient and better at converting power into performance, which is especially important when climbing hills or running long distances.

## How to Improve PWR?

- **Increase Power Output:** Through strength training and focused workouts.
- **Reduce Body Weight:** In a healthy way, without compromising performance.
