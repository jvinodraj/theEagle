## Explanation of Metrics and Formulas

### 1. **Pace (min/km):**
   Use race pace as a reference for different run types:
   - Easy Runs: ~60-75% of 5k pace.  
   - Tempo Runs: ~85-90% of 5k pace.  
   - Marathon Pace Runs: Based on marathon goal time.

### 2. **Heart Rate (HR Zones):**
   - Zone 1: 50-60% of Max HR  
   - Zone 2: 60-70% of Max HR  
   - Zone 3: 70-80% of Max HR  
   - Zone 4: 80-90% of Max HR  
   - Zone 5: 90-100% of Max HR
