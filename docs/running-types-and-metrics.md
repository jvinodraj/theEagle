## Explanation of Metrics and Formulas

### 1. **Pace (min/km):**
   Use race pace as a reference for different run types:
   - Easy Runs: ~60-75% of 5k pace.  
   - Tempo Runs: ~85-90% of 5k pace.  
   - Marathon Pace Runs: Based on marathon goal time.

---

### 2. **Heart Rate (HR Zones):**
   - Zone 1: 50-60% of Max HR  
   - Zone 2: 60-70% of Max HR  
   - Zone 3: 70-80% of Max HR  
   - Zone 4: 80-90% of Max HR  
   - Zone 5: 90-100% of Max HR  

   **Example Max HR Formula:**  

   `Max HR = 220 - Age`


---

### 3. **Cadence (SPM):**
Higher cadence reduces overstriding and improves efficiency. Aim for 160‚Äì180 spm depending on the run type.

---

### 4. **Vertical Oscillation (VO):**
Reduce VO for more efficient running:
- Easy Runs: ~7-10 cm  
- Speed Work: ~6-8 cm  

---

### 5. **Ground Contact Time (GCT):**
Lower GCT indicates faster leg turnover and efficiency:
- Easy Runs: ~250‚Äì300 ms  
- Speed Work: ~180‚Äì220 ms  

---

### 6. **Stride Length (SL):**
Adjust stride length naturally with speed and cadence:

`Stride Length (m) = (Speed (m/s) / Cadence (spm)) √ó 60`


---

## Order of Focus for Improvement

1. **Cadence:** A cornerstone metric for all run types; improves form and reduces overstriding.  
2. **Pace Control:** Key for progression runs, tempo, and race simulations.  
3. **HR Zones:** Maintain proper intensity to target aerobic or anaerobic systems.  
4. **Stride Efficiency:** Combine cadence and stride length for optimal forward motion.  
5. **VO and GCT:** Advanced metrics to refine form and minimize energy waste.
