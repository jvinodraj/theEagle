### üß© **Understanding Amino Acids**

Think of **amino acids** as **tiny building blocks**, like Lego pieces. When you link a bunch of amino acids together:  you get a **protein**.

Just like different Lego shapes make different models, different combinations of amino acids create different proteins in your body.

### üß¨ **How Many Are There?**

There are **20 amino acids** in total:

* üü¢ **9 Essential**:  Your body **can‚Äôt make these**, so you **must get them from food** (like meat, eggs, beans, etc.)
* üîµ **11 Non-Essential**:  Your body **can make these on its own**

---

### üí™ **What Do Proteins (and Amino Acids) Do?**

They help:

* Build and repair **muscles**
* Grow **skin, hair, and nails**
* Make **hormones** and **enzymes**
* Support your **immune system**

Basically, **they're involved in nearly everything your body does.**

---

### üç≥ **Good Protein Sources = All Essential Amino Acids**

These are called **‚Äúcomplete proteins‚Äù**, and include:

* Eggs
* Chicken
* Fish
* Dairy
* Soy and quinoa

Incomplete proteins (like rice or beans) are missing one or more essentials  but when combined, they **still give your body what it needs** (e.g., rice + beans = complete).

---

### üß† Simple Analogy:

* **Amino acids = letters**
* **Proteins = words**
* **You = a walking novel made from protein ‚Äúwords‚Äù written with amino acid ‚Äúletters.‚Äù**

## üü¢ **9 Essential Amino Acids**

(You **must** get these from food)

| Amino Acid        | Function / Role                                                     | Food Sources             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Histidine**     | Helps make histamine (immune & digestion), supports myelin (nerves) | Meat, dairy, eggs        |
| **Isoleucine**    | Muscle repair, energy regulation                                    | Chicken, fish, eggs      |
| **Leucine**       | Muscle building, recovery, blood sugar control                      | Beef, whey, soy          |
| **Lysine**        | Collagen production, calcium absorption                             | Cheese, lentils, quinoa  |

## üîµ **11 Non-Essential Amino Acids**

(Your body **can make these** itself)

| Amino Acid                       | Function / Role                      | Food Sources          |

| **Alanine**                      | Helps remove toxins from muscles     | Meat, poultry, fish   |
| **Arginine** *(semi-essential)*  | Wound healing, blood flow            | Turkey, pumpkin seeds |
| **Asparagine**                   | Nervous system function              | Dairy, beef, eggs     |
| **Aspartic acid**                | Energy production                    | Sugar cane, meats     |
| **Cysteine** *(semi-essential)*  | Antioxidant production (glutathione) | Broccoli, poultry     |
| **Glutamic acid**                | Brain fuel, neurotransmitter         | Seaweed, soy sauce    |
| **Glutamine** *(semi-essential)* | Gut health, muscle repair            | Beef, eggs            |
| **Glycine**                      | Collagen, skin, joints, sleep        | Gelatin, bone broth   |
| **Proline**                      | Collagen & tissue healing            | Cheese, egg whites    |
| **Serine**                       | Brain development, metabolism        | Soy, eggs, nuts       |

### Notes:

* **Semi-essential amino acids** (like arginine, glutamine, cysteine): Your body can make them, **but not always enough**;  especially during stress or illness.
* **BCAAs** (Branched-Chain Amino Acids): These are **leucine, isoleucine, valine**;  popular for **muscle recovery and performance**.
