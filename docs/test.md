Sample Script
1. Introduction

Good morning/afternoon, everyone. My name is [Your Name], and today I’ll be walking you through our Data Observability and Governance Framework application, which is deployed on Snowflake using Streamlit. This application is designed to help you monitor, manage, and optimize your data quality, operational metrics, financial operations, and data access in a unified interface.

2. Overview of the Application

At a high level, this application provides a comprehensive dashboard for data governance and observability. It allows users to:

Configure and monitor data quality rules,
Track operational and financial metrics,
Analyze data access patterns,
And manage alerts and notifications.
3. Navigation and User Experience

The application features a sidebar navigation menu, allowing you to easily switch between different modules:

Home
DQ Monitoring
FinOps Resources
Data Access and Privacy Management
Each module is designed to be intuitive, with clear buttons and interactive dashboards.

4. Walkthrough of Key Features

a. Home Page

The Home page provides quick access to all major modules. You can jump directly to DQ Monitoring, Ops Monitoring, FinOps, Data Classification, or Data Access Management.

b. DQ Monitoring

Under DQ Monitoring, you’ll find several subpages:

Initial Configuration: Select your database, schema, and table to set up metadata.
Create & Map DQ Rule: Define and assign data quality rules to specific columns.
Rules Scheduler: Schedule automated rule execution using cron expressions.
Dashboard: View data quality scores and trends over time.
Alert Configuration: Set up threshold-based alerts and configure notification emails.
c. FinOps Resources

The FinOps module provides insights into warehouse usage, query performance, and cost metrics. You can filter by warehouse, user, query status, and more, and visualize credit consumption and resource utilization.

d. Data Access and Privacy Management

This section displays access history and patterns, helping you monitor who accessed which data objects and how frequently, supporting compliance and privacy requirements.

5. Technical Highlights

The application is tightly integrated with Snowflake, leveraging live data for all dashboards and reports. It uses session state to maintain user selections and provides interactive, real-time analytics. The UI is built with Streamlit, ensuring a modern and responsive experience.

6. Q&A

That concludes the walkthrough. I’d be happy to answer any questions or demonstrate specific features in more detail.
