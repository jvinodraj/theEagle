# Important Medical Tests for Runners

> **Purpose**: This document is intended as a **knowledge and awareness guide** for runners (5K, 10K, Half Marathon, Full Marathon, Ultra). It explains *which medical tests matter*, *why normal ranges may not be optimal for runners*, and *how to interpret results from a performance perspective*.

> ⚠️ **Medical Disclaimer**:
> This content is **for educational purposes only**. Lab values must **always be interpreted by a qualified doctor** in the context of symptoms, medical history, and training load. **Do not self-diagnose or self-medicate based on this document.**

## 1. Complete Blood Count (CBC)

### Key Parameters

| Test              | General Normal Range | Optimal for Runners | Interpretation for Runners                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hemoglobin (g/dL) | Men: 13–17           | **14–16**           | Carries oxygen. Low values reduce VO₂ max and endurance.     |

**Runner Insight:**
Normal CBC values can still mask *early iron deficiency* or *training-induced anemia*.

## 2. Iron Profile (CRITICAL FOR RUNNERS)

### Required Tests

* Serum Ferritin
* Serum Iron
* TIBC
* Transferrin Saturation

| Test                       | General Normal | Optimal for Runners | Interpretation                                               |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ferritin (ng/mL)           | 30–300         | **50–150**          | #1 endurance marker. Low ferritin = fatigue, breathlessness. |
| Serum Iron (µg/dL)         | 60–170         | **80–140**          | Reflects circulating iron.                                   |
| Transferrin Saturation (%) | 20–50          | **25–40**           | Indicates iron availability to muscles.                      |

**Runner Insight:**
Ferritin <30 may be "normal" but causes **poor stamina and slow recovery** in runners.

## 3. Vitamin Levels

### Vitamin B12

| Normal Range  | Optimal for Runners |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| 200–900 pg/mL | **>400 pg/mL**      |

**Interpretation:**
Low B12 reduces red blood cell quality and nerve-muscle coordination.

### Vitamin D (25-OH)

| Normal Range | Optimal for Runners |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| 20–100 ng/mL | **40–60 ng/mL**     |

**Interpretation:**
Low Vitamin D increases injury risk, muscle weakness, and immune illness.

## 4. Inflammation & Recovery Markers

| Test                  | Normal Range | Optimal for Runners | Interpretation                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ESR (mm/hr)           | 0–10         | **<5**              | Chronic elevation → inflammation/poor recovery.      |
| hs-CRP (mg/L)         | <3           | **<1**              | Detects systemic inflammation & overtraining.        |

## 5. Kidney & Hydration Markers

| Test               | Normal Range | Runner Interpretation                              |
| ------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Creatinine (mg/dL) | 0.7–1.3      | Slightly higher may be normal in muscular runners. |
| Sodium (mmol/L)    | 136–145      | Low = hyponatremia risk during races.              |
| Potassium (mmol/L) | 3.5–5.1      | Low = cramps, arrhythmia risk.                     |
| Magnesium (mg/dL)  | 1.7–2.4      | **>2.0 preferred** for endurance.                  |

## 6. Hormonal & Stress Markers (Advanced)

| Test               | Optimal          | Interpretation                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Morning Cortisol   | Mid-normal       | Chronic high = overtraining.       |
| Testosterone (Men) | Mid–upper normal | Low = poor recovery & muscle loss. |

## 7. Final Notes for Runners

* "Normal" lab ranges are based on **sedentary populations**
* Endurance training **changes physiology**
* Always look at **trends**, not single values
* Combine lab data with:

  * Training load
  * Sleep quality
  * Nutrition
  * Injury history
