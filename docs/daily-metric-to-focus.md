# **Runner's Daily Metrics Reference**

## **Daily Metrics to Monitor**

### **1. Body Battery (Garmin)**
- **Optimal Range:** 50-100 (good recovery and readiness to train)
- **Low (<30):** Indicates fatigue or poor recovery (consider rest)
- **High (>80):** Suitable for high-intensity workouts

### **2. Resting Heart Rate (RHR)**
- **Elite Runners:** 40-50 bpm
- **Well-Trained:** 50-60 bpm
- **General Fitness:** 60-70 bpm
- **Warning Sign:** If RHR increases by >5-10 bpm, it may indicate fatigue, stress, or illness.

### **3. Power-to-Weight Ratio (Running FTP / Body Weight)**
- **Beginner:** 2.5 - 3.5 W/kg
- **Intermediate:** 3.5 - 4.5 W/kg
- **Advanced:** 4.5 - 5.5 W/kg
- **Elite:** 5.5+ W/kg
- **Your Goal:** Improve from 4.59 W/kg towards 5 W/kg

### **4. Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**
- **Excellent Recovery:** 70-100 ms (higher is better, low stress, high parasympathetic tone)
- **Good Recovery:** 50-70 ms (healthy individuals)
- **Fatigue:** 30-50 ms (under mild stress)
- **Warning Sign:** A drop of >30 ms may indicate poor recovery, high stress, over training or poor sleep

  > ⚠️ Note: HRV is **highly individual**. What's low for one person may be normal for another. **Trends over time** are more useful than single readings.

### **5. Sleep Duration & Quality**
- **Total Sleep:** 7-9 hours per night
- **REM Sleep:** 1.5-2 hours
- **Deep Sleep:** 1-2 hours
- **Impact:** Poor sleep leads to higher RHR and reduced performance

### **6. Running Cadence (Steps per Minute)**
- **Optimal Range:** 175-185 spm

### **7. Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR)**
- **Your Current LTHR:** check yours from fitness app (ex: 175 bpm)
- **Goal:** Improve pace at LTHR with Zone 2 & tempo runs

The **optimal range for Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR)** varies based on fitness level and training background. It is typically:  

  - **Untrained Individuals**: 70–80% of Max Heart Rate (HRmax)  
  - **Recreational Runners**: 80–85% of HRmax  
  - **Elite Endurance Athletes**: 85–90% of HRmax  

#### **Formula to Estimate LTHR**  
A common way to estimate LTHR is:  
`LTHR = HRmax * (0.80 to 0.90)`

Where **HRmax** is your maximum heart rate.

#### **Example Calculation**
If your **HRmax is 190 bpm**:

`LTHR = 190 * 0.85 = 161.5 bpm`

### **8. VO2 Max (Aerobic Capacity)**
- **Your Current VO2 Max:** check your fitness app (ex: 50 ml/kg/min)
- **Target:** 60+ ml/kg/min (Elite Level)

### **9. Running Efficiency & Vertical Oscillation**
- **Optimal Vertical Oscillation:** 6-8 cm
- **Warning:** If >10 cm, focus on core strength & shorter ground contact time

### **10. Hydration & Weight Fluctuations**
- **Daily Fluid Intake:** 2.5 - 3.5L/day(depends on your body weight + workout sweat loss)
- **Post-Run Weight Loss:**
  - **>2% loss:** Suggests dehydration → Increase electrolytes

### **11. Muscle Oxygen Saturation (SmO2) - If Available**
- **Optimal:** 60-80% during easy runs
- **Low (<50%)** may indicate fatigue or oxygen inefficiency
