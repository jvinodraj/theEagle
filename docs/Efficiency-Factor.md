## Efficiency Metrics Overview

Running efficiency reflects how effectively a runner converts energy into forward motion. Efficient runners require less energy at a given speed. Efficiency is influenced by:

* Power output (W)
* Vertical oscillation (VO)
* Stride length (SL)
* Cadence
* Ground contact time (GCT)
* Heart rate (HR)

## Metrics and Formulas

### 1. **Running Economy (RE)**

**Formula:**

```
RE = VO2 (ml/kg/min) at a given speed
```

**Use case:** Long-term fitness tracking, comparing performance across runners.

**Example:**

* Runner A: VO2 = 42 at 5:00/km
* Runner B: VO2 = 38 at 5:00/km → Runner B is more economical

**Use to:** Identify aerobic efficiency, track adaptation over time

---

### 2. **Mechanical Efficiency (Distance per Watt)**

**Formula:**

```
Efficiency (m/W) = Speed (m/s) ÷ Power (W)
```

**Use case:** Monitor real-time efficiency and energy cost.

**Example:**

* Speed = 4.0 m/s, Power = 400W → Efficiency = 0.010 m/W

**Use to:** Detect fatigue (drop in efficiency), track form changes

---

### 3. **Vertical Oscillation Ratio (VOR)**

**Formula:**

```
VOR = VO / Stride Length
```

**Use case:** Gauge movement economy.

**Example:**

* VO = 8 cm, SL = 1.2 m → VOR = 0.066

**Use to:** Optimize vertical motion, detect bounding or inefficient strides

---

### 4. **Ground Contact Time (GCT)**

**Definition:** Duration foot stays on the ground per stride.

**Use case:** Identify fatigue or injury risk.

**Example:**

* GCT increases over intervals → early fatigue or poor form

**Use to:** Fine-tune form and balance

---

### 5. **Stride Length Efficiency**

**Formula:**

```
Stride Efficiency = SL ÷ Power
```

**Use case:** Balance stride length against energy cost.

**Example:**

* SL = 1.3 m, Power = 350W → Efficiency = 0.00371

**Use to:** Optimize stride training
