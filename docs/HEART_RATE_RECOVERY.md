# Heart Rate Recovery (HRR) Guide for Runners

Heart Rate Recovery (HRR) is a powerful metric that measures how quickly your heart rate drops after exercise. It is a direct indicator of cardiovascular fitness and autonomic nervous system health.

## Why HRR Matters
* **Fitness Tracking:** As your fitness improves, your heart rate will drop faster.
* **Recovery Monitoring:** A slow recovery can be an early warning sign of overtraining, dehydration, or illness.
* **Efficiency:** Shows how quickly your body switches from "Fight or Flight" (Sympathetic) to "Rest and Digest" (Parasympathetic) mode.

## How to Measure (Garmin Users)
If you are using a device like the **Garmin Forerunner Series**, follow these steps:

1. **Stop the Timer:** At the end of your run, press the **START/STOP** (top-right) button.
2. **Access the Menu:** Do **NOT** select "Save" yet. Use the **DOWN** button to scroll through the post-activity options.
3. **Select Recovery HR:** Highlight **"Recovery Heart Rate"** and press the **START** button.
4. **The Countdown:** A 2-minute timer will appear. For the most accurate results, **stand still** or sit down during these two minutes.
5. **Read the Result:**
   - **The large number:** The total beat drop (e.g., 45 bpm).
   - **The small number:** Your current heart rate at the end of the 2 minutes.
6. **Save Activity:** Once the 2 minutes are up, the result is recorded. Press the **BACK** button to return to the main menu and select **Save**.

> **Note:** If you save the activity immediately after stopping, you will miss the window to record the specific "Recovery HR" data point on the watch.

## Expectations by Run Type
The "normal" drop depends on the intensity of your session. Use this table as a general benchmark:

| Run Type | Intensity Zone | Starting HR (Est.) | Target 2-Min Drop |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intervals/Sprints** | Zone 4/5 | 175+ bpm | **45 - 60+ bpm** |
| **Tempo / Threshold** | Zone 3/4 | 160 - 175 bpm | **35 - 50 bpm** |
| **Base / LSD** | Zone 2 | 130 - 150 bpm | **20 - 35 bpm** |
| **Recovery Run** | Zone 1 | < 130 bpm | **15 - 20 bpm** |

## Quick glossary
- Sympathetic nervous system: “fight or flight” — raises heart rate during exercise/stress.
- Parasympathetic nervous system: “rest and digest” — slows heart rate during recovery.
- Stroke volume: the amount of blood pumped by the heart each beat; stronger hearts typically pump more blood per beat, so resting heart rate and recovery can improve with training.
