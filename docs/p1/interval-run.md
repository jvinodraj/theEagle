### How Pace is Derived from Your Personal Bests

Calculate your **goal race pace** and compare it to your **current race pace** using this basic formula:

#### **Pace = Total Time ÷ Distance**

Assuming your **5K Personal Best: 23:51**

* 23 minutes 51 seconds = **1,431 seconds**
* Distance = **5 kilometers**

**Pace = 1,431 ÷ 5 = 286.2 seconds/km = 4:46/km**

That’s your **current average 5K pace**.

To go **sub-20**, you must complete 5K in:

* **20:00 = 1,200 seconds**
* **Pace = 1,200 ÷ 5 = 240 seconds/km = 4:00/km**

**Goal pace = 4:00/km**
**Current pace = 4:46/km**

That’s a difference of **46 seconds per km** — meaning you need to shave off:

* \~9 sec/km per month (if aiming for sub-20 in 5–6 months)

This pace gap is absolutely bridgeable **with a smart plan**, especially since your aerobic base is already solid.
