**Strength Training Plan for 5K Runners** ‚Äî built for **speed, explosive power, core stability, and injury prevention**. The 5K is short but intense, requiring **high neuromuscular coordination**, **VO‚ÇÇ max utilization**, and **efficient biomechanics**.

---

### **Strength Training Plan ‚Äî 5K Focus**

**5K race demands:**

* Explosive power for fast starts and surges
* High turnover speed with minimal ground contact
* Postural strength for efficient form
* Injury resilience from high-intensity load

## Strength Load Calculation (for \~70‚ÄØkg runner)

| Focus Area             | Weekly Volume Target | Why It Matters for 5K          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Explosive Strength** | 250‚Äì300 reps         | Sprint speed, cadence control  |
| **Muscular Endurance** | 600‚Äì800 reps         | Maintain pace under fatigue    |
| **Core Stability**     | 3‚Äì4 sessions/week    | Upper body drive, breathing    |
| **Mobility / Prehab**  | 2√ó/week              | Injury prevention, free stride |

---

## 1. **Lunges (Speed Power + Control)**

üîπ **Target**: 250 reps/week
üîπ **Breakdown**:

* Jumping Lunges: `3√ó15 reps`
* Walking Lunges (light weights): `2√ó20 reps/leg`
* Reverse Lunges (explosive step-back): `2√ó10 reps/leg`

üìå **Purpose**:

* Builds unilateral power and hip control for quick, fluid strides.

---

## 2. **Squats (Explosiveness + Acceleration)**

üîπ **Target**: \~200 reps/week
üîπ **Breakdown**:

* Jump Squats: `3√ó15 reps`
* Goblet Squats: `3√ó10 reps (15kg)`
* Split Squats: `2√ó10/leg`

üìå **Purpose**:

* Enhances vertical force production and turnover speed.

---

## 3. **Calf Raises & Plyo (Ground Contact Efficiency)**

üîπ **Target**: 300+ reps/week
üîπ **Breakdown**:

* Single-leg Calf Raises: `3√ó20 reps/leg`
* Weighted Standing Raises: `3√ó12 reps`
* Skipping or Jump Rope: `3√ó50 skips`

üìå **Purpose**:

* Builds resilient lower legs and supports high-cadence turnover.

---

## 4. **Core Stability (Form at Max Effort)**

üîπ **Target**: 3‚Äì4 sessions/week
üîπ **Breakdown**:

* Front Planks: `2√ó60s`
* Side Planks + Leg Raise: `2√ó45s/side`
* Mountain Climbers: `3√ó30 reps`
* Dead Bugs: `2√ó20 reps`

üìå **Purpose**:

* Supports form control during high-effort sprinting and hill surges.

## ‚úÖ Key Differences: 5K vs 10K vs Half Marathon

| Feature           | 5K Plan            | 10K Plan              | Half Marathon Plan     |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Weekly Volume     | \~1000 reps        | \~1200 reps           | \~1500 reps            |
| Explosive Focus   | High               | Moderate-High         | Moderate               |
| Core Volume       | High (4√ó/week)     | Moderate (3√ó/week)    | Medium (3√ó/week)       |
| Strength Focus    | Fast twitch + form | Power-endurance combo | Endurance with support |
| Injury Prevention | Ankle, knee, hips  | Hips, calves, core    | Posterior chain focus  |

## üõ†Ô∏è Optional Add-ons

* **Bounding drills / A-Skips / Hill sprints** (1√ó/week)
* **Mini resistance bands** for hip/glute activation
* **Lateral movement drills** (side lunges, skater hops)

---

## üîÅ Integration with Run Plan

* Strength on non-quality run days (e.g., post-easy run or in PM)
* Avoid lower body strength within 24h of interval/sprint sessions
* Deload every 4th week (\~50% volume and intensity)
