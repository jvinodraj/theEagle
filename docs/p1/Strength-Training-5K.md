**Strength Training Plan for 5K Runners** ‚Äî built for **speed, explosive power, core stability, and injury prevention**. The 5K is short but intense, requiring **high neuromuscular coordination**, **VO‚ÇÇ max utilization**, and **efficient biomechanics**.

---

### **Strength Training Plan ‚Äî 5K Focus**

**5K race demands:**

* Explosive power for fast starts and surges
* High turnover speed with minimal ground contact
* Postural strength for efficient form
* Injury resilience from high-intensity load
