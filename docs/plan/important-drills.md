## 🔧 What to Change (and Why)

| Parameter                     | Your Goal                  | Expected Range   | How to Improve                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stride Length**             | ↑ (target \~1.9–2.0 m)     | \~1.9–2.1 m      | Plyometrics, bounding drills, hip flexor mobility, power-focused strides |
| **Cadence**                   | ↑ (target \~185–190 spm)   | 185–190 spm      | Shorten ground contact, avoid overstriding, use metronome                |
| **GCT (Ground Contact Time)** | ↓ (target 180–200 ms)      | \~180 ms         | Strengthen glutes/calves, barefoot drills, plyo                          |
| **Vertical Ratio (VR)**       | ↓ (target 5–6%)            | \~5.2–5.8%       | Control bounce, push backward not upward                                 |
| **Form**                      | Forward lean, compact arms | Efficient        | Drill-based: A/B skips, posture checks, mirror running                   |

### 🚨 Real Talk: It’s Not Just Form

To hit **2:50 pace at 330W**, you’d need to **match best biomechanics**, running economy, and weight ratio **perfectly** — which is nearly impossible for non-elite runners. He’s 52–54 kg, highly economical, and genetically gifted.

But you *can* close the gap by:

1. **Reducing energy leaks** (less bounce, tighter core, stable arms)
2. **Improving elastic recoil** (plyometrics + drills)
3. **Improving strength-to-weight ratio**
4. **Training cadence-stride dynamics** (with data from your device)

## 🔁 Practical Drill-Based Suggestions

| Drill                             | Helps With                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **High-Knees + Fast Feet Drills** | Cadence + GCT                        |
| **Bounding / A-Skips**            | Stride length + power                |
| **Jump rope (barefoot)**          | Lower GCT, improve ground stiffness  |
| **Mirror running**                | Reduce vertical bounce (VR)          |
| **Sprint drills 30–50m**          | Train force application and turnover |

## ✅ Summary

For **without more power**, you must:

* **Increase stride** (through explosive drills + flexibility)
* **Slightly increase cadence** (but don’t overdo)
* **Lower GCT and VR** (focus on elasticity and bounce control)
* **Strengthen core & glutes** (for better transfer of force)
