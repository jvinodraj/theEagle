### Warup and Cool down - Personalised Training from Mar 2025 to June 2025 on Monday except HM training

**Warm-up (10–15 min):**  
- **5–10 min easy jog** (~8:00–9:00/km pace — Zone 1-2)  
- **3 x 20 sec strides** (~5:00/km pace with 1 min walk/jog recovery between) — to activate fast-twitch muscles
  - **Focus on Form, Not Just Speed**  
    - Quick, **relaxed turnover** (cadence around 180+ steps per minute).  
    - Powerful but **smooth strides**—not overstriding.  
    - Land **midfoot** with an upright posture.  
  - **Effort Level:** ~**85–90% of max speed** (not an all-out sprint).  
  - **Gradual Build-Up:**  
    - First 10 sec: Ease into speed  
    - Middle 10 sec: Hit peak controlled speed  
    - Last 10 sec: Gradually slow down  
- **1–2 min easy jog** to settle your heart rate  

**Main Workout:**  
- **4 x 3 min @ 4:30/km pace** (Zone 4-5)  
- **3 min jog recovery between each interval** (~8:00–9:00/km pace)  

**Cool-down (10–15 min):**  
- **5–10 min easy jog** (~8:00–9:00/km pace — Zone 1)  
- **5 min static stretching** (hamstrings, quads, calves, hip flexors)
