### 🏋️ **Strength Training Plan — 10K Run Focus**

A 10K demands:

* Strong **running economy**
* High **lactate threshold**
* Efficient **neuromuscular coordination**
* Fatigue resistance in the **final 2–3 km**

## 🔢 **Strength Load Calculation (Based on 70kg Runner)**

| Focus Area             | Weekly Volume Target | Why It Matters for 10K      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Explosive Strength** | 250–300 reps         | Kick speed, hill surges     |
| **Muscular Endurance** | 800–1,000 reps       | Maintain pace form          |
| **Core Stability**     | \~3–4 sessions       | Mid-run posture & breathing |
| **Mobility/Prehab**    | 2×/week              | Injury prevention           |

## 🦵 1. **Lunges (Power + Endurance)**

🔹 **Target**: \~300 reps/week
🔹 **Breakdown**:

* Walking Lunges: `3×20 reps/leg`
* Jumping Lunges: `2×15 reps`
* Reverse Lunges (with 10kg DB): `2×10 reps/leg`

📌 **10K Purpose**:

* Develops hip drive, glute activation, mid-race power surges.

---

## 🏋️ 2. **Squats (Explosiveness + Stride Power)**

🔹 **Target**: \~250 reps/week
🔹 **Breakdown**:

* Jump Squats: `3×15 reps`
* Bulgarian Split Squats: `2×10 reps/leg (weighted)`
* Bodyweight Squats: `3×25 reps`

📌 **10K Purpose**:

* Enhances **VO₂ max output** through neuromuscular demand.
* Improves **running stride propulsion**.

---

## 🦶 3. **Calf Raises (Speed & Bounce)**

🔹 **Target**: \~300–350 reps/week
🔹 **Breakdown**:

* Single-Leg Calf Raises: `3×20 reps/leg`
* Seated Weighted Calf Raises: `3×12 reps`
* Jump Rope (plyo): `3×50 skips`

📌 **10K Purpose**:

* Enhances cadence & rebound effect, crucial for fast turnover.

---

## 🔁 4. **Core & Posture (Mid-race control + Breathing)**

🔹 **Frequency**: 3×/week
🔹 **Breakdown**:

* Front Plank: `2×60s`
* Side Plank + Leg Raise: `2×30s/side`
* Bicycle Crunch: `2×25`
* Dead Bug: `3×15`

📌 **10K Purpose**:

* Controls trunk rotation for efficient arm-leg coordination.
* Supports diaphragmatic breathing.

## 📅 Weekly Strength Routine for 10K Runners

| Day     | Focus                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Mon** | Squats + Lunges + Core            |
| **Wed** | Calf Raises + Jump Rope + Core    |
| **Fri** | Mobility + Glutes + Light Core    |
| **Sat** | Plyo (Jump Squats, Lunges) + Core |

## ✅ Key Differences from FM Strength Plan

| Area               | FM Plan                    | 10K Plan                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Weekly Volume**  | \~2000 reps                | \~1000–1200 reps               |
| **Explosive Work** | Moderate (less risk)       | High (more plyo emphasis)      |
| **Core Volume**    | High for posture endurance | Medium for breathing/stability |
| **Focus**          | Fatigue resistance         | Speed-endurance & power output |
| **Recovery Need**  | Higher (long mileage load) | Faster recovery cycles         |

## 🛠 Integration with Running

* **Strength Days**: Do after easy runs or as separate PM sessions.
* **Avoid**: Heavy lower body strength 1 day before interval/tempo workouts.
* **Deload** every 4th week by reducing reps to 50% volume.

---

## 🧘 Optional Add-ons (for 10K Runners)

* **Hip Mobility Routine**: Before tempo/intervals
* **Jump Rope Drills**: Add before speed runs
* **Lateral Band Walks**: For knee & glute alignment
