**Strength Training Plan for 5K Runners** built for **speed, explosive power, core stability, and injury prevention**. The 5K is short but intense, requiring **high neuromuscular coordination**, **VO₂ max utilization**, and **efficient biomechanics**.

---

### **Strength Training Plan — 5K Focus**

**5K race demands:**

* Explosive power for fast starts and surges
* High turnover speed with minimal ground contact
* Postural strength for efficient form
* Injury resilience from high-intensity load

## Strength Load Calculation (for \~70 kg runner)

| Focus Area             | Weekly Volume Target | Why It Matters for 5K          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Explosive Strength** | 250–300 reps         | Sprint speed, cadence control  |
| **Muscular Endurance** | 600–800 reps         | Maintain pace under fatigue    |
| **Core Stability**     | 3–4 sessions/week    | Upper body drive, breathing    |
| **Mobility / Prehab**  | 2×/week              | Injury prevention, free stride |

---

## 1. **Lunges (Speed Power + Control)**

🔹 **Target**: 250 reps/week
🔹 **Breakdown**:

* Jumping Lunges: `3×15 reps`
* Walking Lunges (light weights): `2×20 reps/leg`
* Reverse Lunges (explosive step-back): `2×10 reps/leg`

📌 **Purpose**:

* Builds unilateral power and hip control for quick, fluid strides.

---

## 2. **Squats (Explosiveness + Acceleration)**

🔹 **Target**: \~200 reps/week
🔹 **Breakdown**:

* Jump Squats: `3×15 reps`
* Goblet Squats: `3×10 reps (15kg)`
* Split Squats: `2×10/leg`

📌 **Purpose**:

* Enhances vertical force production and turnover speed.

---

## 3. **Calf Raises & Plyo (Ground Contact Efficiency)**

🔹 **Target**: 300+ reps/week
🔹 **Breakdown**:

* Single-leg Calf Raises: `3×20 reps/leg`
* Weighted Standing Raises: `3×12 reps`
* Skipping or Jump Rope: `3×50 skips`

📌 **Purpose**:

* Builds resilient lower legs and supports high-cadence turnover.

---

## 4. **Core Stability (Form at Max Effort)**

🔹 **Target**: 3–4 sessions/week
🔹 **Breakdown**:

* Front Planks: `2×60s`
* Side Planks + Leg Raise: `2×45s/side`
* Mountain Climbers: `3×30 reps`
* Dead Bugs: `2×20 reps`

📌 **Purpose**:

* Supports form control during high-effort sprinting and hill surges.

| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Mon** | Squats + Lunges + Core Stability         |
| **Wed** | Jump Rope + Calf Raises + Core           |
| **Fri** | Plyometrics + Glute Activation + Core    |
| **Sat** | Explosive Lunges + Short Mobility + Core |

## ✅ Key Differences: 5K vs 10K vs Half Marathon

| Feature           | 5K Plan            | 10K Plan              | Half Marathon Plan     |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Weekly Volume     | \~1000 reps        | \~1200 reps           | \~1500 reps            |
| Explosive Focus   | High               | Moderate-High         | Moderate               |
| Core Volume       | High (4×/week)     | Moderate (3×/week)    | Medium (3×/week)       |
| Strength Focus    | Fast twitch + form | Power-endurance combo | Endurance with support |
| Injury Prevention | Ankle, knee, hips  | Hips, calves, core    | Posterior chain focus  |

## 🛠️ Optional Add-ons

* **Bounding drills / A-Skips / Hill sprints** (1×/week)
* **Mini resistance bands** for hip/glute activation
* **Lateral movement drills** (side lunges, skater hops)

---

## 🔁 Integration with Run Plan

* Strength on non-quality run days (e.g., post-easy run or in PM)
* Avoid lower body strength within 24h of interval/sprint sessions
* Deload every 4th week (\~50% volume and intensity)
