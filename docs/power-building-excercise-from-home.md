### **Exercise that Increases Running Power (Watts)?**  

When it comes to running power (measured in watts), **dynamic exercises** generally contribute more because they improve **neuromuscular coordination, stride efficiency, and explosive strength**. However, **static exercises** also help by increasing **muscle endurance and stability**, which can indirectly enhance power.

#### **Top Exercises for Increasing Running Power**  
1. **Plyometrics (Dynamic) 🏃‍♂️**  
   - Exercises: Box jumps, bounding, depth jumps, squat jumps  
   - **Impact:** Improves **explosive strength**, increasing peak power output in each stride.  

2. **Sprint Training (Dynamic) ⚡**  
   - Exercises: Hill sprints, resisted sprints  
   - **Impact:** Develops **fast-twitch muscle fibers**, increasing force per step.  

3. **Strength Training (Static & Dynamic) 🏋️‍♂️**  
   - Exercises: Deadlifts, squats, Bulgarian split squats  
   - **Impact:** Builds **leg and core strength**, improving power transfer.  

4. **Core Training (Static) 🏋️**  
   - Exercises: Planks, side planks, hanging leg raises  
   - **Impact:** Enhances **stability**, reducing energy loss during running.

### **How Much Power (Watts) Will Be Added?**  
Power increase depends on factors like **training intensity, weight, and running efficiency**. A rough estimation can be made using the **Power Formula**:  

#### **Power Formula for Running (Stryd/Garmin-based Approximation)**  

`P = (F * v) / η 

Where:  
- \( P \) = Running power (watts)  
- \( F \) = Ground reaction force (dependent on body weight)  
- \( v \) = Running speed (m/s)  
- ( η ) = Efficiency factor (typically 20-25%)  

#### **Example Power Gains from Training:**  
| Exercise | Estimated Power Increase (Watts) per Session |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Plyometrics (Bounding) | +5-15W |
| Sprint Training (Hill sprints) | +10-25W |
| Heavy Squats (Strength) | +3-10W |
| Core Stability (Planks) | +1-5W |
| Combined Training (4-6 weeks) | +30-50W |

🔹 **Realistic Expectation:** A well-structured **6-8 week** power-focused training can increase running power by **~5-15%** based on starting fitness levels.
