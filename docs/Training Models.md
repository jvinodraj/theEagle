## 1. Introduction

Endurance training is the cornerstone of success for runners, whether training for a 5K or a marathon. This guide presents the most widely accepted endurance training models, explains how training intensity zones are defined, and helps you structure your training based on scientific research and coaching best practices.

## 2. Overview of Training Intensity Zones

Most training models rely on a 5-zone system:

| Zone | Intensity             | Physiological Focus                  |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Very Easy             | Active recovery, blood flow          |
| 2    | Easy (Aerobic)        | Fat metabolism, aerobic base         |
| 3    | Moderate (Threshold)  | Lactate clearance, sustainable pace  |
| 4    | Hard (VO2 Max)        | Maximal aerobic capacity             |
| 5    | Very Hard (Anaerobic) | Speed and neuromuscular improvements |

## 3. Major Endurance Training Models

### 3.1 Polarized Training Model

Polarized training is based on the idea that most training should be either very easy or very hard, with minimal time spent at moderate intensities. Research by Seiler et al. found that elite endurance athletes achieve significant improvements by distributing about 80% of their training in low-intensity zones (Zone 1–2) and 20% in high-intensity zones (Zone 4–5).

| Feature            | Description                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Intensity Mix      | \~80% Zone 1–2, \~20% Zone 4–5             |
| Avoided Zone       | Zone 3 (threshold)                         |
| Scientific Support | Seiler et al. (2007)                       |
| Ideal For          | VO2 max improvement, long-term development |

---

### 3.2 Threshold Training Model

The Threshold model emphasizes sustained efforts near the lactate threshold—roughly the highest intensity that can be maintained for 30–60 minutes. Jack Daniels and others have shown that regular training at this level helps athletes improve pace sustainability and lactate clearance.

| Feature            | Description                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Intensity Mix      | High focus on Zone 3          |
| Key Workouts       | Tempo runs, cruise intervals  |
| Scientific Support | Daniels (2005), Foster (1995) |
| Ideal For          | 10K to half marathon racing   |

---

### 3.3 Pyramidal Training Model

Pyramidal training involves a high volume of low-intensity work, a moderate amount of threshold training, and a small proportion of high-intensity intervals. The shape resembles a pyramid: broad base, narrow peak. It allows for a balanced progression and is commonly used by distance runners and marathoners.

| Feature            | Description                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Intensity Mix      | Mostly Zone 1–2, some Zone 3, minimal Z4–5 |
| Progression        | Gradual intensity increase                 |
| Scientific Support | Esteve-Lanao et al. (2017)                 |
| Ideal For          | Marathon prep, general fitness             |

---

### 3.4 High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)

HIIT focuses on short bursts of very hard effort followed by rest or low-intensity recovery. It’s known for improving VO2 max quickly and is often used in short training blocks or by athletes with limited time. However, it carries a higher risk of overtraining if not properly managed.

| Feature            | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Intensity Mix      | High frequency of Zone 4–5 efforts               |
| Key Workouts       | 30s–4min intervals                               |
| Scientific Support | Helgerud et al. (2001), Laursen & Jenkins (2002) |
| Ideal For          | VO2 max gains, time-limited athletes             |

---

### 3.5 Sweet Spot Training Model

Originating in cycling, Sweet Spot Training targets an intensity just below threshold (roughly 88–94% of threshold). It offers a strong stimulus for aerobic development without the recovery demands of full-threshold or VO2 max sessions. It is efficient and highly popular for base building.

| Feature       | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Intensity Mix | Upper Zone 3                              |
| Focus         | High aerobic stress, lower recovery needs |
| Popular In    | Cycling, endurance base blocks            |
| Ideal For     | Intermediate runners, off-season build    |

---

### 3.6 Zone 2-Only (Maffetone) Model

Popularized by Phil Maffetone, this model focuses entirely on building the aerobic base by staying strictly within Zone 2. It is especially suitable for beginners or athletes recovering from injury. While progress may be slow, it builds strong aerobic foundations with minimal injury risk.

| Feature            | Description                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Intensity Mix      | 100% in Zone 2                    |
| Focus              | Fat metabolism, aerobic endurance |
| Scientific Support | Maffetone (1999)                  |
| Ideal For          | Beginners, injury-prone runners   |

## 4. Structure of Training Blocks

Endurance training is best organized into macro, meso, and microcycles:

| Block Type | Duration  | Purpose                        |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Base       | 4–8 weeks | Aerobic development, form      |
| Build      | 4–6 weeks | Add threshold/VO2 work         |
| Peak       | 2–4 weeks | Race pace sharpening, tapering |
| Transition | 1–2 weeks | Recovery, mental reset         |

Typical weekly layout:

* 1–2 quality sessions (tempo or intervals)
* 2–4 easy runs
* 1 long run
* 1 rest or cross-training day

## 5. Comparison of Training Models

| Model       | Intensity Mix     | Best For                  | Notes                             |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Polarized   | 80/20 (Z1–2/Z4–5) | VO2 max, long-term gains  | Avoids mid-intensity fatigue      |
| Threshold   | High Z3 focus     | HM/10K pace improvement   | Can cause overtraining if misused |
| Pyramidal   | Gradual Z1–Z3     | General fitness, marathon | Balanced and scalable             |
| HIIT        | Frequent Z4–5     | Time-crunched, VO2 max    | Risk of burnout if overused       |
| Sweet Spot  | Upper Z3          | Intermediate athletes     | Efficient training stimulus       |
| Zone 2 Only | 100% Z2           | Beginners, injury-prone   | Low injury risk, high patience    |

## 6. Choosing the Right Model

| Athlete Type   | Recommended Model     |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Beginner       | Zone 2, Pyramidal     |
| Intermediate   | Pyramidal, Threshold  |
| Elite/Advanced | Polarized, Sweet Spot |
| Time-Crunched  | HIIT, Polarized       |
| Injury-Prone   | Zone 2 Only           |

Consider testing lactate threshold or HR zones to personalize training. Tools like Garmin, Stryd, or lab testing are valuable.

## 7. Practical Recommendations

1. Start with aerobic base (Z2) regardless of level
2. Add intensity gradually using one model (don’t mix too early)
3. Track training load (HRV, RPE, TSS)
4. Rest and recovery are non-negotiable
5. Change blocks every 4–6 weeks
6. Taper before races
