### **1. Prepare for the Test**
- Ensure your **Garmin Running Power app** or power meter (e.g., Stryd) is set up. / Data Layouts available in your run 
- Get a **flat course or treadmill** to ensure consistent effort.  
- Do this **well-rested**, as the test is intense.  
- Enable **Lap Button Press** (so you can manually mark start/stop).  

---

### **2. Warm-Up Phase (15-20 min) – Neuromuscular & Aerobic Priming**  
- **10:00 min @ Zone 2** (Easy aerobic jogging to elevate core temperature and activate metabolic pathways).  
- **Strides: 3-4 x 20-30 sec @ ~90% of Max Effort** (Neuromuscular activation)  
  - **Recovery: 1:00 min @ Zone 1-2** (Easy jog) between reps.  
- **3:00 min @ Tempo Pace (~85% of Threshold Power)** (Priming lactate clearance mechanisms).  
- **3:00 min @ Zone 1 (Easy Jogging)** (HR stabilization before maximal effort). 

---

### **3. 20-Minute Time Trial (Maximal Aerobic Power Assessment)**  
- **Intensity:** **Sustain the highest possible steady-state power output** over 20 minutes.  
- **Pacing Strategy:**  
  - First **3-5 minutes:** Ramp to target effort without early surges.  
  - **Mid-section (5-15 min):** Maintain steady power output with minimal fluctuations.  
  - **Final 5 minutes:** If sustainable, increase intensity slightly (~2-5% surge).  
- **Data Recording:**  
  - **Use Lap Function** to segment the test and extract mean power (or) manual calculation after parsing fit file.  
  - **Monitor Power Meter** to assess pacing consistency.  

---

### **4. Cool Down (10-15 min) – Cardiovascular & Neuromuscular Recovery**  
- **10-15 min @ Zone 1** (Gradual HR reduction to baseline).  
- **Post-Test Recommendations:** Hydration, mobility drills, and review of data trends. 

---

### **5. Calculate Your FTP**
After the run, check your **average power for the 20-minute effort**:  
- **FTP Estimate** = **(20-min avg power) × 0.90**. (sometimes 95%)  
- This approximates your **1-hour FTP**  

If using **Stryd**, it may calculate FTP automatically.  

---

### **6. Update Training Zones**
After finding FTP, set up your **running power zones** in **Garmin Connect**:  
1. **Go to Garmin Connect** → Devices → Your Watch → User Settings → Heart Rate and Power Zones.  
2. Enter your FTP and set zones based on %FTP (e.g., Zone 2 = 55-75% FTP, traditional one). **Garmin overlaps** with traditional zones and use it accordingly.
3. Garmin uses a simplified FTP zone system as below

| **Zone** | **% of FTP**  | **Description** | **Purpose** |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Zone 1 – Active Recovery**  | **65-80%**   | Easy effort, low-intensity | Recovery, warm-up, cool-down |
| **Zone 2 – Endurance** | **80-90%**  | Moderate effort | Builds aerobic base, improves fat metabolism |
| **Zone 3 – Tempo**  | **90-100%**  | Sustainable, moderate-hard effort | Improves lactate clearance, increases muscular endurance |
| **Zone 4 – Threshold** | **100-115%** | Hard, near FTP | Increases FTP and lactate threshold |
| **Zone 5 – Anaerobic** | **>115%** | Maximum effort, short bursts | Increases anaerobic power, sprinting ability |

### **7. Data Processing & FTP Calculation**  - [Garmin Support](https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=zjEjScVGhU5allXvFdaMl5)
1. **Compute FTP:(traditional)**  
   - FTP = **0.95 × Mean Power from 20-minute effort**  
   - Example: If **20-minute Avg Power = 300W**, then **FTP = 285W**.
---

### **Alternative (Ramp Test)**
If a 20-minute test is too hard, try a **Ramp Test**:
- Increase effort **every 1-2 minutes** until failure.  
- Your FTP is ~75% of your **peak 1-minute power**.
