### **1. Prepare for the Test**
- Ensure your **Garmin Running Power app** or power meter (e.g., Stryd) is set up. / Data Layouts available in your run 
- Get a **flat course or treadmill** to ensure consistent effort.  
- Do this **well-rested**, as the test is intense.  
- Enable **Lap Button Press** (so you can manually mark start/stop).  

---

### **2. Warm-Up (15-20 min)**
- **10 min** easy Zone 2 jogging  
- **3-4 strides** (20-30 sec at 90% effort, 1 min recovery)  
- **3 min** at a moderate effort (~Tempo Pace)  
- **3 min** easy jogging before the test  

---

### **3. 20-Minute Time Trial**
- Run as **hard as you can maintain** for 20 minutes (avoid early burnout).  
- Keep a **steady pace**—power should not drop significantly after 5-10 minutes.  
- Use **Lap Button** to mark the start & end of the effort.  

---

### **4. Cool Down (10-15 min)**
- Slow jogging or walking until HR stabilizes.  

---

### **5. Calculate Your FTP**
After the run, check your **average power for the 20-minute effort**:  
- **FTP Estimate** = **(20-min avg power) × 0.95**  
- This approximates your **1-hour FTP**  

If using **Stryd**, it may calculate FTP automatically.  

---

### **6. Update Training Zones**
After finding FTP, set up your **running power zones** in **Garmin Connect**:  
1. **Go to Garmin Connect** → Devices → Your Watch → User Settings → Running Power Zones.  
2. Enter your FTP and set zones based on %FTP (e.g., Zone 2 = 55-75% FTP).  

---

### **Alternative (Ramp Test)**
If a 20-minute test is too hard, try a **Ramp Test**:
- Increase effort **every 1-2 minutes** until failure.  
- Your FTP is ~75% of your **peak 1-minute power**.
