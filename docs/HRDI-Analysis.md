# Heart Rate Drift Index (HRDI) Analysis

## Formula for HRDI
HRDI is calculated using the formula:

$$
HRDI = \frac{\left( \text{Avg HR (2nd Half)} - \text{Avg HR (1st Half)} \right)}{\text{Avg HR (1st Half)}} \times 100
$$

## HRDI Interpretation

| HRDI (%)  | Interpretation          |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| < 0%      | Unusual / Data Issue    |
| 0 - 2%    | Normal                  |
| 2 - 5%    | Slight Drift (Good)     |
| 5 - 10%   | Moderate Drift (Caution) |
| > 10%     | High Drift (Needs Attention) |

## Possible Causes of High HRDI

| Cause            | Indicators |
|-----------------|------------|
| **Dehydration**  | Sweat loss > 2% body weight, HR spikes despite constant effort |
| **Poor Aerobic Base** | Mileage < 40km per week, low endurance at steady paces |
| **Fatigue**      | Resting HR > 10% of baseline, lack of sleep, prolonged soreness |
| **Overtraining** | HRV < 20, frequent exhaustion, declining performance |

## Recommendations Based on Mileage

| Weekly Mileage (km) | Aerobic Base Level | Recommendation |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| < 30 km            | Weak              | Increase base runs, focus on Zone 2 training |
| 30 - 50 km         | Moderate          | Maintain steady-state runs, build endurance |
| 50+ km             | Strong            | Optimize interval training, race-specific workouts |

### Notes
- If HRDI is high **due to dehydration**, ensure proper hydration pre-run.
- If HRDI is high **due to a weak aerobic base**, prioritize base-building at low intensity.
- **Fatigue** requires proper recovery with sufficient sleep and nutrition.
- **Overtraining** should be addressed by reducing intensity and incorporating rest weeks.
