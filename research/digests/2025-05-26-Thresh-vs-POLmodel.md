# Research Digest: Why 80/20 Training Works for Elites

**Ever wondered how Olympic athletes structure their training?**
The answer is simple but powerful: they go easy most of the time.

A landmark study by **Seiler & Kjerland (2006)** revealed that elite endurance athletes follow the **80/20 rule**—training **80% at low intensity** and **20% at high intensity**. This distribution forms the backbone of the **Polarized Training Model**.

## What the Research Shows

In a pivotal study (Seiler & Kjerland, 2004), 11 elite Norwegian endurance athletes were observed over a year. Their training intensity distribution looked like this:

* \~80% of sessions were low intensity
* \~5% were moderate intensity
* \~15–20% were high intensity

## Threshold Training: The “Grey Zone” Grind

Before the 80/20 model gained traction, many athletes trained near their lactate threshold—an approach known as **Threshold Training**. This involves spending most of your time in **Zone 3**:

* **Too hard to recover from easily**
* **Too easy to induce peak adaptation**

### Heart Rate Zones (by % HRmax):

* **Zone 1:** 50–60% – Recovery
* **Zone 2:** 60–70% – Aerobic base
* **Zone 3:** 70–80% – Tempo (the “grey zone”)
* **Zone 4:** 80–90% – VO₂ max
* **Zone 5:** 90–100% – Anaerobic/neuromuscular

Zone 3 (Threshold Training) may feel productive but tends to increase fatigue with diminishing returns—especially for elite runners.

## Polarized Training: The Elite Blueprint

Elite athletes favor the **Polarized Model**: a deliberate avoidance of the middle (moderate) zone. Instead, they train either:

* **Very Easy (Zone 1–2)** to build endurance and recover
* **Very Hard (Zone 4–5)** to improve VO₂ max and top-end performance

### Why it Works:

* **Zone 1–2 (50–80% HRmax)**: Builds aerobic capacity and supports recovery
* **Zone 3 (Grey Zone)**: Offers limited benefit and adds fatigue
* **Zone 4–5 (90–100% HRmax)**: Triggers major physiological adaptation

The key is **intensity polarization**—training at the extremes.

## Head-to-Head: Threshold vs. Polarized

### (a) **Threshold Model**

* Focuses between **LT1 and LT2** (first and second lactate thresholds)
* Most sessions fall in **Zone 3**
* Promotes lactate clearance but increases fatigue

### (b) **Polarized Model**

* Emphasizes:

  * **High volume** below LT1 (Zone 1–2)
  * **High intensity** work at 90–100% VO₂ max (Zone 5)
* Almost no work in **Zone 3**

> 🧠 Conclusion: Threshold training wears you down slowly. Polarized training builds you up sharply.

## How the Study Was Conducted

1. **Warm-up**: 30 minutes
2. **Incremental Treadmill Test**:

   * 10% incline
   * Start at 6 km/h
   * Increase 0.6 km/h every minute until exhaustion
3. **Breath-by-breath gas analysis**:

   * Oxygen (VO₂), CO₂ (VCO₂) measured via Jaeger Oxycon Pro
   * Revealed energy systems and thresholds in real time

Researchers analyzed each session by:

* **Heart Rate (HR)**
* **Session RPE (Perceived Effort)**

Both metrics showed a clear pattern:

> **Most sessions were easy, a few were hard, and very few were in the middle.**

This subset included:

* HR data
* RPE scores
* Blood lactate values

All three methods confirmed the same principle:

> **Elite athletes consistently avoided the grey zone.**

## Summary

Polarized training works because it:

* **Maximizes aerobic development** through volume
* **Drives peak performance** with sharp intensity
* **Minimizes injury and fatigue** by avoiding no-man’s-land intensity

Whether you're an Olympian or a committed amateur, the evidence is clear:
**Train mostly easy. Push occasionally hard. Avoid the middle.**
