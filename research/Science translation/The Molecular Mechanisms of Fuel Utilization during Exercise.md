# Fuel Utilization During Exercise

## 🔍 Introduction

* Muscles require **ATP (energy)** to contract.
* ATP is regenerated by breaking down either **glucose (sugar)** or **fatty acids (from body fat)**.
* In this section, we'll explore **how your body chooses which fuel to use**, depending on **how hard and how long you exercise**.

No matter what you're doing—reading a book or going for a run—your body is always using nutrients for energy. But before your body can use that energy, it has to turn it into a high energy molecule called **ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)**. 

Your body makes ATP in two main ways:

1. **With oxygen** – this is called **aerobic metabolism**
2. **Without oxygen** – this is called **anaerobic metabolism**

Which method your body uses mostly depends on how much oxygen is available and what kind of nutrients (carbs, fats, or proteins) are being burned at the time.

On the otherhand, during physical activity, your muscles require energy, which they derive from various fuel sources. Your body mainly uses **carbohydrates and fats** to provide that energy. The kind of fuel it uses depends on things like how **intense** your workout is, how **long** it lasts, and your body’s **fitness level**.

## 1. **Energy Substrates During Exercise**

During physical activity, the body utilizes various energy substrates to meet the increased energy demands:

* **Glucose**: Stored as glycogen in muscles and liver, it's a primary energy source, especially during high-intensity exercise.
* **Fatty Acids**: Derived from adipose tissue and intramuscular triglycerides, they become the predominant fuel during prolonged, moderate-intensity exercise.
* **Ketone Bodies**: Produced in the liver from fatty acids, they serve as alternative energy sources during prolonged fasting or low-carbohydrate intake.
* **Amino Acids**: Utilized during prolonged exercise when glycogen stores are depleted, contributing to gluconeogenesis. 

## ⚡ Energy Sources During Exercise

### 1. **Carbohydrates**

* **Glycogen**: Stored in muscles and liver; primary source during high-intensity workouts.
* **Glucose**: Circulates in the blood; quickly mobilized for immediate energy needs.

### 2. **Fats**

* **Free Fatty Acids (FFAs)**: Released from adipose tissue; predominant during prolonged, moderate-intensity exercise.
* **Intramuscular Triglycerides (IMTGs)**: Stored within muscle fibers; utilized during endurance activities.

### 3. **Ketone Bodies**

* Produced in the liver from fatty acids; serve as alternative fuel during prolonged fasting or low-carbohydrate intake.

### 4. **Amino Acids**

* Derived from muscle protein breakdown; contribute to energy production during extended or intense exercise sessions.

## 🏃‍♂️ Application During Running

* **0–10 seconds (e.g., sprint start):** The **ATP-PC system** is the primary energy source, providing immediate energy for explosive movements.

* **10–120 seconds (e.g., 400m to 800m run):** **Anaerobic glycolysis** becomes dominant, supplying quick energy but leading to lactate accumulation.

* **2–20 minutes (e.g., 5K to 10K run):** **Aerobic glycolysis** takes over, efficiently producing ATP using glucose with oxygen.

* **20+ minutes (e.g., marathon):** **Aerobic lipolysis** becomes significant, utilizing fat stores for sustained energy during prolonged, lower-intensity runs.([Energy Systems][1])

## 💪 Muscle Fiber Recruitment

| **Muscle Fiber Type**                 | **Activated During**                   | **Energy System Utilized**             | **Characteristics**                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Type I (Slow-twitch)**              | Low-intensity, endurance activities    | Aerobic systems (glycolysis/lipolysis) | High fatigue resistance, efficient oxygen use, suited for prolonged activities |
| **Type IIa (Fast-twitch oxidative)**  | Moderate to high-intensity efforts     | Both aerobic and anaerobic systems     | Intermediate fatigue resistance, versatile for various intensities             |
| **Type IIx (Fast-twitch glycolytic)** | High-intensity, short-duration efforts | Anaerobic systems (ATP-PC, glycolysis) | High power output, quick fatigue, suited for explosive movements               |

During running, the recruitment of muscle fibers follows the **size principle**:

1. **Type I fibers** are activated first during low-intensity efforts.

2. As intensity increases, **Type IIa fibers** are recruited.([Sport Science Insider][2])

3. For maximal efforts, **Type IIx fibers** are engaged.

This progression ensures energy efficiency and optimal performance across varying intensities.
