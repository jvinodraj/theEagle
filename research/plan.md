## üîπ 12-Month Career Growth Plan

### **Phase 1 (Months 1‚Äì3): Foundation & Positioning**

**Goal:** Sharpen coding depth + identify gaps in system-level knowledge.

* **Skill Focus**

  * Revisit **data structures & algorithms** (not for interviews only, but to think in performance terms).
  * Study **Python performance tuning** (profiling, memory optimization, concurrency).
  * Learn **system design for data pipelines** (scalability, fault tolerance, latency).

* **Practice**

  * Start solving **LeetCode / HackerRank / Project Euler** (1 problem/day).
  * Optimize your **existing Python code** at work with profiling tools (`cProfile`, `line_profiler`).

* **Positioning**

  * Begin writing short **LinkedIn posts** about what you learn (start building your voice).

---

### **Phase 2 (Months 4‚Äì6): Deep Tech in Data Engineering**

**Goal:** Get recognized as a system design & performance optimization specialist in data pipelines.

* **Skill Focus**

  * Learn **advanced database internals** (Postgres, BigQuery, columnar stores, indexes, query planning).
  * Study **distributed systems** concepts (Kafka, Spark, Flink, Airflow internals).
  * Hands-on with **cloud optimizations** (GCP BigQuery optimization, partitioning, clustering).

* **Practice**

  * Pick a **real dataset** (e.g., Strava activity logs) ‚Üí build and optimize a **pipeline** ‚Üí publish results.
  * Write a **blog/tutorial** on how you improved performance (e.g., ‚ÄúOptimizing BigQuery cost by 40% with partitioning‚Äù).

* **Positioning**

  * Contribute to **open-source data engineering tools** (e.g., Apache Airflow, dbt, DuckDB). Even small bug fixes count.
  * Start networking with data engineering communities (Slack groups, conferences).

---

### **Phase 3 (Months 7‚Äì9): Expert Recognition**

**Goal:** Build visibility as an expert.

* **Skill Focus**

  * Master **Python + C hybrid performance** (Cython, Rust with PyO3, Numba).
  * Explore **modern data formats** (Parquet, Arrow) and how they impact performance.
  * Learn **observability in pipelines** (logging, tracing, metrics for performance).

* **Practice**

  * Publish a **whitepaper-style article**: ‚ÄúHow I built a high-performance data pipeline handling X GB/day.‚Äù
  * Do a **conference talk proposal** (local meetups, PyData, GCP community events).

* **Positioning**

  * Keep an **active blog/GitHub**.
  * Build your **personal brand**: share coding philosophies + lessons (TEDx angle: ‚ÄúThe discipline of deep coding‚Äù).

---

### **Phase 4 (Months 10‚Äì12): Career Leverage & Thought Leadership**

**Goal:** Convert expertise into salary growth + recognition.

* **Skill Focus**

  * Study **advanced system design for large-scale data systems** (think FAANG-level design).
  * Learn **performance benchmarking frameworks** and apply them.

* **Career Growth**

  * Target **specialist roles** (Senior Data Engineer, Data Architect, Performance Engineer).
  * Prepare **salary negotiations** with strong portfolio proof (GitHub, blogs, talks).

* **Thought Leadership**

  * Apply to **speak at a local TEDx** or technical conference (topic: coding discipline, data engineering performance hacks, or system design lessons).
  * Mentor juniors in your org or community ‚Üí reinforces your authority.

---

## üìÖ Weekly Routine (1 Hour/Day)

* **Mon‚ÄìWed** ‚Üí Coding practice (algorithms + system design problem).
* **Thu** ‚Üí Work on open-source project / personal repo.
* **Fri** ‚Üí Write LinkedIn/blog post.
* **Sat** ‚Üí 2-hr deep dive (optional, use weekends for longer learning).
* **Sun** ‚Üí Reflection + plan next week.
